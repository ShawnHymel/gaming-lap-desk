# Custom Gaming Lap Desk

> **IMPORTANT!** This is a work in progress and highly personalized custom lap desk. If you wish to recreate it, you will need to buy the exact hardware I list, as the 3D models were expressly designed to fit the keyboard, mouse pad, XBox controller, cup, etc.

> **NOTE**: The `gaming-lap-desk.FCStd` parts are not recomputing in FreeCAD for some reason. While you can use the exported STL files, making modifications beyond that will be difficult. This is a known issue. I can't promise I'll fix it, as this was a one-time project for me.

`STL/` contains the exported STL files for 3D printing.

All parts were designed in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).

## Hardware

You will need exactly these parts, unless you modify the CAD designs.
